# kineticsPy

Python package for chemical kinetics simulations.
 
This package is intended to provide:

+ Automation of simulations
+ Data analysis and visualization of kinetic simulation results
+ Implementations of simple kinetic models

This package is primarily intended to serve as an interface to the chemical kinetics solver  [Cantera](https://cantera.org/).
