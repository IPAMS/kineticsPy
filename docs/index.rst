=====================
Welcome to kineticsPy 
=====================

kineticsPy is an interface and result analysis / visualization python package for chemical kinetics simulations. 

Introduction and Overview
=========================

kineticsPy allows to run kinetic simulations with known kinetics solver codes, analyze and visualize the results of the simulations. Currently the primary supported solver code is `Cantera <https://cantera.org/>`_. 

--------
Features
--------

The current main features are: 

    * Running simple ideally stirred reactor simulations in Cantera
    * Analyzing and visualization of simulation results
